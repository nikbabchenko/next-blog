My name is Nick Babchenko and I'm Javascript Engineer for *more than 6 years* now. 

Most of the time I was working on enterprise projects with very different frontend stack, based on Angular, Vue.js, React.js even such kind of technologies like Stencil.js or Preact.js. 

I was working with different hybrid frameworks like, 
React Native, Electron, Flutter, Ionic etc.

So, with this zoo in mind, the closest relationships I have with Angular. 
I've started to learn it from the most heroic framework -  Angular.JS (1.x), and then learned it from scratch since Angular 4.0.
