My name is Nick Babchenko and I'm the Javascript Engineer for **more than 6 years** now.

I've started to learn web development when I was 10. Finished local web-development courses. 
But due to some reasons decided to learn economics first. 

I've become the Master of Banking and time by time it helps me in my coding career and in every day life. 
So, I'm the fan of Das Capital of K.Marx, theories of A. Smith and so on.

Anyways during several years of working in economic sphere I worked as web developer in parallel as hobby until I haven't switched to full time job as web developer.

First 2 years I mostly worked on creating stunning landing pages and wordpress blogs. And that period give me a lot of html and css experience. Learning different approaches of css naming conventions like BEM, SMACSS, OOCSS, Atomic CSS etc. I realised how should be organised css in different situation and choose my favorite approach.

After some period of time I became interested in how to create dynamic web apps, so I've decided to dive deeply into Javascript and it's frameworks. 

My first framwework was one the most heroic - Angular.js and after jQuery it feels like something super new, cool and stunning. It's two way data-binding was like a miracle. 

And more I learned JS more interested it was to me. So, then there was Angular 2 (Angular), React.js, Stencil.js, Vue.js.

I haven't missed hybrid development with Ionic and React Native, but my favorite in this 'hybrid' list for now is 
Flutter.


I haven't missed server-side train and gave a try electron as desktop dev-kit. Nest.js, Express.js as server-side frameworks, and of course tried to create apps with raw Node.js. 

Finally, need to mention also Docker stuff, Google's firebase, Google Cloud Functions etc.

But, most of the time in past 4 years I was working on enterprise projects with very different frontend stack, based on Angular and React.js and less on Stencil.js, Vue.js, Preact.js.

So, with this zoo in mind, the closest relationships I have with Angular. 
I've started to learn it from -  Angular.JS (1.x), and then learned it from scratch since Angular 4.0.
