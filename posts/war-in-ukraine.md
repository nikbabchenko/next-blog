The Ukrainian people have been living in the darkness of war for 370 days now. 
Almost a year passed since we have woken up because of the airstrikes all over the country. We didn't believe that it was a first day of the russian invasion of Ukraine until we saw the news. 
The Mr. President Zelensky showed himself as the real leader of the Ukrainian nation. Every day, even several times a day from the 24 february 2022 we see his report about the current status of the Ukrainian war, what has been done during the day, our achievements and problems. 

He inspired Ukrainian people to go to the army to defend our country, make donations go to territorial defense, and become a volunteer. He showed by example that the Ukraine is worth standing for it and we for the first time believe in our President.

Moreover, the people all over the world were inspired by our President. His strength, courage and self-sacrifice for the peace in Ukraine. 
Every day, hour, minute he is doing everything to bring closer our victory.

The war has taken a heavy toll on the Ukrainian people, with thousands killed and millions displaced. 
The war has been a long and difficult one for the Ukrainian people.

I still couldn't believe that a year has been passed. A year of the Great Russian Ukrainian War! The battle between the true red evil and the Great independent people of the Independent Democratic Country. I've voted for my President, as 75% of the people of Ukraine. So, we actually elected our President. And I have big doubts that the Russian president has been truly elected. But we don't care about if he is legal on not in Russian, because it's the independent country. They can do there what they want. If the people couldn't raise against the regime - it's their choice. But please, keep your hands off Ukraine!
